## Simplifying Updates for You

From my experience, manually checking for Flatpak updates can be tedious, especially if you forget or donâ€™t feel like dealing with it. This script automates the process, saving you time and ensuring your Flatpak apps are always up to date without any `hassle`.
Why Use It?

I believe this script could really help users who prefer a `set-and-forget` method to keep their apps updated. Instead of manually running flatpak update, it handles everything through a simple `systemd service` and `timer`. It checks for updates as soon as your *system boots, every six hours, and when your PC wakes from suspend.*

If youâ€™re like me and appreciate automating routine tasks, youâ€™ll likely find this useful. The script also ensures that updates occur even if your machine was asleep, keeping everything current.
How It Works

-    Checks if Flatpak is installed: Before running anything, the script checks if Flatpak is installed on your system.
-    Creates a `systemd service`: This runs the `flatpak update -y` command to update all your Flatpak apps without asking for confirmation.
-    Sets up a timer: The update process is scheduled to run right after boot, every `six` hours, and after waking up from `suspend`. This means you donâ€™t have to worry about forgetting to check.
-    Enables and starts the timer: It sets everything in motion right away, making sure the updates happen automatically.
-    Displays status: At the end of the process, it shows you the status of both the service and timer, so you know when the next update is coming.

## Who Should Use This?

If you use Flatpak often and like the idea of keeping your apps up to date automatically, this script is a perfect fit. Itâ€™s especially helpful if you donâ€™t want to think about updating and prefer using `systemd` over `cron` jobs. 

I feel itâ€™s a solid choice for people who keep their system on all the `time` or use `suspend`.

*However, if youâ€™re someone who prefers reviewing updates before installation or doesnâ€™t use Flatpak much, this may not be necessary for you.*
