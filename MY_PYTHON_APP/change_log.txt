Change Log

March 27, 2025  
- Initial version of LinuxTweaks installer and uninstaller created  
- Installer checks for dependencies (Python3, PyQt6, Git) and installs them via `dnf` or `pacman`  
- Repository cloned or updated in the temporary directory  
- Application files copied to `/usr/local/bin/LinuxTweaks`, symlink created at `/usr/local/bin/linuxtweaks`  
- Autostart entry added to `~/config/autostart/linuxtweaksdesktop`, desktop shortcut created  
- Uninstaller created to stop the app process and remove application files, symlink, autostart entry, cloned repo, and desktop shortcut  

Failed/Inactive State:  
- Installer failed to properly check and install dependencies on some systems  
- Some users experienced issues with repo cloning due to directory permission errors  
- Symlink creation failed in certain cases where directory paths were not correctly handled  
- Autostart entry and desktop shortcut not created on some systems due to missing user permissions

-----------------------------------------

March 28, 2025  
- Fixed issues with file permissions in the temporary clone directory  
- Improved repo cloning and updating by adding checks for existing repositories  
- Ensured proper cleanup of cloned repository after deployment  
- Adjusted permissions to ensure all copied files are executable  
- Improved directory creation for autostart entries and desktop shortcuts  

Failed/Inactive State:  
- Issues persisted with file permissions in the temporary clone directory, causing installer failures  
- Repository cleanup didn't occur in some cases after the deployment  
- Permissions for the copied files were incorrectly set, causing issues with executable files not running

-----------------------------------------

March 31, 2025  
- Updated script for proper symlink creation of `linuxtweaks` in `/usr/local/bin`  
- Fixed bug where symlink pointed to the wrong location  
- Adjusted system path permissions for automatic execution of `linuxtweaks` via symlink  
- Updated installer script for better directory permissions, avoiding execution errors  
- Fixed issues with desktop shortcut creation and permissions  
- Simplified the uninstaller for a more efficient cleanup process  

Failed/Inactive State:  
- Symlink was not always created correctly, causing execution failures  
- Automatic execution failed due to incorrect system path permissions  
- Autostart entry creation failed in certain desktop environments, leading to the app not starting automatically after installation

-----------------------------------------

April 1, 2025  
- Modified installer to create symlinks and auto-execute the app after installation with a more robust method  
- Added final checks to ensure symlink and autostart entry are created correctly  
- Resolved issues that prevented automatic startup of the Python application after installation  
- Cleaned up redundant code, improving maintainability  

Failed/Inactive State:  
- Symlink creation and auto-execution method was unstable, resulting in inconsistent app launches after installation  
- The uninstaller occasionally left residual files on the system, causing issues when reinstalling  
- Some redundant steps in the installer caused performance issues
