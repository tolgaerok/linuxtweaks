Change Log

March 27, 2025  
- Created the initial version of the LinuxTweaks installer and uninstaller  
- The installer checks for required dependencies (Python3, PyQt6, Git) and installs them using `dnf` or `pacman`, depending on the package manager  
- The repository is either cloned or updated in a temporary directory  
- Copied application files to `/usr/local/bin/LinuxTweaks` and created a symlink in `/usr/local/bin/linuxtweaks`  
- Added an autostart entry to `~/config/autostart/linuxtweaksdesktop` and created a desktop shortcut  
- The uninstaller was created to stop the app process, remove the application files, symlink, autostart entry, cloned repo, and desktop shortcut

March 28, 2025  
- Fixed issues with file permissions in the temporary clone directory  
- Improved the cloning and updating of the repository by adding checks to ensure an existing repository is properly updated  
- Ensured that the cloned repository was cleaned up correctly after deployment  
- Adjusted permissions for all copied files to ensure they are executable  
- Made sure the autostart entries and desktop shortcut directories were created correctly

March 31, 2025  
- Updated the script to ensure the symlink for `linuxtweaks` is created properly in `/usr/local/bin`  
- Fixed a bug where the symlink pointed to the wrong location, causing execution issues  
- Adjusted system path permissions to allow for the automatic execution of `linuxtweaks` through the symlink  
- Improved the installer script to handle directory permissions more efficiently and avoid execution errors  
- Fixed minor issues with desktop shortcut creation and permissions  
- Simplified the uninstaller by removing unnecessary checks and directly cleaning up installed files

April 1, 2025  
- Modified the installer to create symlinks and execute the app automatically after installation using a more robust method (Still a bug) 
- Added final checks to the installer to ensure the symlink and autostart entry are created correctly  
- Debugged and resolved issues that prevented the Python application from automatically starting after installation (Still a bug)   
- Cleaned up redundant code and streamlined the overall script for better maintainability (On-going)
