March 27, 2025  
- Initial release of LinuxTweaks installer and uninstaller.  
- Installer now checks for necessary dependencies (Python3, PyQt6, Git) and installs them via `dnf` or `pacman` as needed.  
- Repository is cloned or updated to the temporary directory.  
- Application files are copied to `/usr/local/bin/LinuxTweaks`, and a symlink is created at `/usr/local/bin/linuxtweaks`.  
- Autostart entry is added to `~/config/autostart/linuxtweaks.desktop`, and a desktop shortcut is created.  
- Uninstaller functionality added to stop the application and remove all installed files, symlinks, autostart entries, and the cloned repository.  

Issues:  
- Some systems experienced dependency installation failures.  
- Permission issues caused errors with cloning the repository.  
- Symlink creation failed due to incorrect handling of directory paths.  
- Autostart entry and desktop shortcut were not created on some systems due to insufficient user permissions.

March 28, 2025  
- Fixed file permission issues in the temporary clone directory.  
- Improved repository cloning and updating with checks for existing repositories.  
- Ensured proper cleanup of cloned repositories after deployment.  
- Adjusted file permissions to ensure that all copied files are executable.  
- Improved directory creation for autostart entries and desktop shortcuts.  

Issues:  
- Permission issues persisted in the temporary clone directory, causing failures during installation.  
- Repository cleanup did not always occur after deployment.  
- Incorrect file permissions prevented executable files from running.

March 31, 2025  
- Fixed symlink creation issues for `linuxtweaks` in `/usr/local/bin`.  
- Resolved bug where symlink was pointing to an incorrect location.  
- Adjusted system path permissions to ensure proper automatic execution via symlink.  
- Updated installer for better handling of directory permissions, reducing execution errors.  
- Fixed issues related to desktop shortcut creation and permissions.  
- Simplified uninstaller to perform more efficient cleanup.  

Issues:  
- Symlink creation was inconsistent, leading to execution failures.  
- Incorrect system path permissions prevented automatic execution of the application.  
- Autostart entry creation failed in certain desktop environments, causing the application not to start automatically.

April 1, 2025  
- Modified installer to handle symlink creation and automatic execution of the app more reliably.  
- Added final checks to ensure that symlink and autostart entry are properly created.  
- Resolved issues preventing automatic startup of the Python application.  
- Cleaned up redundant code, improving maintainability and stability.  

Issues:  
- The symlink and auto-execution method was occasionally unstable, causing inconsistent application launches.  
- The uninstaller sometimes left residual files, creating issues when reinstalling.  
- Redundant steps in the installer caused minor performance issues.

April 2, 2025  
- Modified installer to handle PyQt6 installation correctly:  
  - The installer now checks if PyQt6 is missing and installs it in the user's local directory using `pip3 --user` when run as root.  
  - If not run as root, PyQt6 is installed for the regular user.  
- Improved dependency installation process: The installer checks and installs dependencies more efficiently, ensuring correct permissions and directory setup.  
- Fixed issues with the automatic installation of PyQt6, resolving the `ModuleNotFoundError`.  

Issues:  
- Installation of PyQt6 could still fail on systems with broken Python environments or missing `pip3`.
